# More Music
Adds a miscellanea of songs from other games like SpaceChem, FTL and some older
factorio soundtracks.

## Todo
- [x] How to setup `track-type`
- [ ] Change loading screen melody to sc-07 intro
- [ ] Add menu song to normal rotation?
- [ ] Can the `planet` property be set to `space` or is that not a real
`SpaceLocationID` ?
- [ ] Add settings to choose which songs to use
- [ ] Is there an easy way for a track to be playable on multiple planets?
besides creating a new entry for every planet?

## Info
